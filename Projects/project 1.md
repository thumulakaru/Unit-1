# Criteria A: Planning

## Problem definition

Ms. Sato is a local trader who is interested in the emerging market of cryptocurrencies. She has started to buy and sell electronic currencies, however at the moment she is tracking all his transaction using a ledger in a spreadsheet which is starting to become burdensome and too disorganized. It is also difficult for Ms Sato to find past transactions or important statistics about the currency. Ms Sato is in need of a digital ledger that helps her track the amount of the cryptocurrency, the transactions, along with useful statistics. 

Apart for this requirements, Ms Sato is open to explore a cryptocurrency selected by the developer.

## Proposed Solution

Design statement:
I will to design and make a Electronic ledger for a client who is Mr. Sato. The ledger will about Tren coin and is constructed using the software Python. It will take Project Week to make and will be evaluated according to the criteria below. I will be using the cryptocurrency TRON.


Justify the tools/structure of your solution

## Tron coin
TRON was founded by Justin Sun in 2017. The TRON Foundation was established in July 2017 in Singapore. The TRON Foundation raised $70 million in 2017 through an initial coin offering shortly before China outlawed the digital tokens. The implementations of TRON require minimal transaction fees in order to prevent malicious users from performing DDoS attacks for free. 1 Tron(TRX) is now exchanged for 8.62 JPY.

## Success Criteria
1. The electronic ledger is a text-based software (Runs in the Terminal).
2. The electronic ledger display the basic description of the cyrptocurrency selected.
3. The electronic ledger allows to enter, withdraw and record transactions.
4. The electronic ledger is password protected.
5. The electronic ledger is able to show records of a selected month.
6. The electronic ledger shows all transactionas related to a category.
